# 📰 Financial Market News Sentiment Analysis

Analyze financial news headlines to infer market sentiment using Python, NLP, and machine learning (LSTM/LSTM+BERT).

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project scrapes and processes financial news headlines, applies NLP techniques to perform sentiment analysis, and explores how sentiment relates to market trends and investment decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans headlines by removing noise, tokenizing, and normalizing.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Implements models (e.g., RandomForest Classification) to label headlines as *positive*, *negative*, or *neutral*.
- **Evaluation**: Includes metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and possibly time-series correlation.
